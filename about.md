I am currently a fourth year student at UCLA studying Applied Mathematics, with a Concentration in Computing and a Minor in Bioinformatics. Though at UCLA, I am currently working with [Dr. Jian Kang](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jiankang/index.html) of the University of Michigan's department of Biostatistics on scalar-on-network regression models with deep learning-based subgroup identification. I formerly worked as an undergraduate researcher at UCLA's [Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences (QCBio)](https://qcb.ucla.edu/) under Dr. Alexander Hoffmann and Dr. Richard Ahn, focusing on bioinformatics work and statistical analyses of genetic and immunology data. 

I intend to pursue graduate school, specifically a PhD program in Biostatistics or Statistics. My primary research interests at the moment are high dimensional data analysis and Bayesian methods. In terms of applications research, I find neuroimaging and survival analysis particularly interesting.
