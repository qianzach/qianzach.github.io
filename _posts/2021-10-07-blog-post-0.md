### Introduction
For this week's post, our goal is to write a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the given Palmer Penguins dataset. 

We'll first read in our data:
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
penguins.head()
```
Here, we observe that there are multiple species within the `penguins` dataset. Therefore, it would be interesting to observe the distribution differences between the three species, Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins. 

Before that, let's load in our packages!

```python
import urllib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Preliminary Cleaning
We can first proceed by creating a function `clean()` that helps clean up our data frame by removing unnecessary columns via `np.drop()`, as well as getting rid of row entries with `NaN` values in the quantitative sections. We have to remove a single outlier in the `Sex` column because it is nonsensical (there is no registered Sex as `.` to my knowledge), and we want to simplify the species names by taking only the first part of the text, which we do through `str.split()`.

```python
def clean(df):
    """
    Using this to clean up the data frame, get rid of rows with NaN values, categorize labels, etc.
    Also to simplify the naming of the species. 
    """
    #get rid of trivial column variables and ridding useless rows
    df = df.drop(['Comments','Sample Number' ,'Date Egg', 'Clutch Completion', 'Individual ID'
                          ,'studyName','Stage', 'Region'], axis =1) #get rid of trivial columns
    df = df.dropna() #rid of NaN rows
    
    df = df[df.Sex != "." ] #omit outlier
    df["Species"] = df["Species"].str.split(" ", n= 1, expand = True)[0] #simplify species name

    return df  
```
Then, we execute it on our data:

```python
penguins = clean(penguins) #clean data
penguins.head()
```
Notice that we have csimpler species names and only columns we want to investigate!

### Histogram: Sex

For our first categorical bar chart, we want to measure frequencies of sex per penguin species. Since we want to make a bi-layer comparison boty *by species and by sex*, we use `multiple = 'dodge'` in seaborn's `histplot()` so it is more interpretable than stacking, as well as overlapping each other. `shrink` is used so the bar plot horizontal components are smaller and clearer aesthetically. 

```python
import seaborn as sns 
sns.histplot(data = penguins, x = "Sex", hue = "Species", multiple="dodge", shrink = 0.8)
```

Observe that the distributions *within* each species are balanced, but there are more Adelie penguins than Gentoo and Chinstrap. 

### Histogram: Islands

In this case, we want to measure frequencies in each penguin species for the islands they inhabit. I opted to use `stack` tto stack frequencies because I wanted to know the final counts of penguins per island. Therefore, using a stack method for `histplot()` works better, with our `x = Island`, and our hue or frame of reference being `hue = Species`.  

```python
sns.histplot(data = penguins, x = "Island", hue = "Species", multiple = "stack",  shrink = 0.8)
```

### Discrete and Continuous Covariates

Now, we want to visualize the numerical covariates. This may show us some insight in any noticeable differences in the flipper size, mass, culmen depth and length, as well as the isotope concentration (Nitrogen-15 and Carbon-13). We can do this first by dropping the `Sex` column and use the `groupby()` function with our key being `Species`, and then using `aggregate()` concurrently with `np.mean()` and `np.var()`. 

```python
penguins.drop(["Sex"], axis = 1).groupby(["Species"]).aggregate([np.mean, np.var])
```
We can see noticeable differences in the summary statistics between species. For one, the Adelie penguins seem to have a much different distribution in culment length than both the Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins. We also see that the Gentoo sample is different from the Adelie and Chinstrap samples in Culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass.

### Plots of Numeric Covariate Columns
Now, we can proceed by plotting all the numeric entries. Because we work WLOG in the way they work, we can iteratively do this.

First, we set `sns.set()` as our default aesthetic (personal choice). Then, we want to save the columns of interest's names in a list so we can use it for iterative purposes for more streamlined code.

After defining our subplots and figures the standard `matplotlib` way using `pyplot`, we can then set our title with `set_title`, and then call `sns.histplot` with the similar parameters that we defined previously. 

Lastly, we use `tight_layout` to adjust our figures so they aren't squished together!

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #import member function

sns.set() # Setting seaborn as default style even if use only matplotlib (my personal favorite)
numerics = ['Culmen Length (mm)', 'Culmen Depth (mm)',
       'Flipper Length (mm)', 'Body Mass (g)',  'Delta 15 N (o/oo)',
       'Delta 13 C (o/oo)'] #save list of column covariates I want to visualize 
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 6, figsize =  (25, 5)) #6 numeric covariates
fig.suptitle("Penguin Attributes: Numerical Covariates") #overarching main title
for i,col in enumerate(numerics): #iterate through our list of column names
    ax[i].set_title(col) #set the subtitle for our ith plot
    sns.histplot(ax=ax[i], data = penguins, x = col, hue = "Species", multiple = "dodge", shrink = 0.8) #plot hist
fig.tight_layout() #make plots cleaner/refined
