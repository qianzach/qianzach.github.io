For this week's post, our goal is to write a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the given Palmer Penguins dataset. 

We'll first read in our data:
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
penguins.head()
```
Here, we observe that there are multiple species within the `penguins` dataset. Therefore, it would be interesting to observe the distribution differences between the three species, Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins.
